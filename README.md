Data visualization is a very important part of data analysis. You can use it to explore your data. If you understand your data well, youâ€™ll have a better chance to find some insights. Finally, when you find any insights, you can use visualizations again to be able to share your findings with other people. Hence we use plots to display the data in a more understandable manner.
